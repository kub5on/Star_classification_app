# Star classification web application
This is an interactive application that allows users to stellar classification. It is based on dataset which consists of 100,000 observations of space taken by the SDSS (Sloan Digital Sky Survey). Every observation is described by 17 feature columns and 1 class column which identifies it to be either a star, galaxy or quasar.
